## Notes

I don't consider myself a beginner in Python, however I am not proficient in it either. I guess I would be at the lower ends of intermediate. I am familiar with PEP 8 and have read it in its entirety, thus, any stylistic deviations I make are probably deliberate. Nevertheless, feel free to point them out if you feel a particular choice of mine was sufficiently erroneous. I am concerned with best practices and readability, but also the performance of my code. I am not sure what tradeoff is appropriate, and would appreciate feedback on the tradeoffs I did make.  
  
My style tends to over utilise functions. This is partly because I genuinely think separating functionality into functions is a good thing, but is also an artifiact of my development practices. I tend to write the program in a Jupyter notebook (the ability to execute arbitrary code excerpts in semi isolated cells is a very helpful development aid and lends itself naturally to one function per cell (with the added benefit of being able to easily test functions independently)). I would welcome thoughts on this, but unless it is particularly egregious, I am unlikely to change it.
